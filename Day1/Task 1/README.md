# ðŸ“š Day 1: Cloud Computing & AWS Fundamentals

Welcome to **Day 1** of the **90 Days of DevOps - 2025 Edition**!  
Todayâ€™s focus is on **AWS pricing models, cloud models, service models (IaaS, PaaS, SaaS)**, and the **history of AWS**.

## âœ… Task 1: AWS Pricing Models

### ðŸ“Œ Introduction
AWS offers multiple pricing models that give flexibility based on workload and usage.  

### ðŸ”¹ Pricing Models

1. **On-Demand Instances**  
   - Pay only for what you use.  
   - No upfront cost.  
   - Best for short-term workloads.  
   - Example: Running a test server for a few hours.  

2. **Reserved Instances**  
   - Commit to 1 or 3 years.  
   - Lower cost compared to On-Demand.  
   - Best for predictable workloads.  
   - Example: A web server running 24/7.  

3. **Spot Instances**  
   - Buy unused EC2 capacity at huge discounts.  
   - Can be terminated anytime by AWS.  
   - Best for fault-tolerant and batch jobs.  
   - Example: Data processing jobs.  

4. **Savings Plans**  
   - Flexible pricing with 1â€“3 year commitment.  
   - Applies to EC2, Fargate, Lambda.  
   - Example: Long-term microservices workloads.

## âœ… Task 2: Cloud Computing Models

### ðŸ“Œ On-Premises
- Infrastructure managed within your organization.  
- Example: Traditional data centers.  
- âœ… Use when: strict data regulations or complete control needed.  

### ðŸ“Œ Cloud
- Infrastructure provided by cloud provider (AWS, Azure, GCP).  
- Example: Hosting apps on AWS EC2.  
- âœ… Use when: scalability, flexibility, and cost-effectiveness needed.  

### ðŸ“Œ Hybrid
- Combination of on-premises + cloud.  
- Example: Sensitive workloads on-premises, public workloads on AWS.  
- âœ… Use when: gradual migration or compliance requirements exist.

## âœ… Task 3: Service Models (IaaS, PaaS, SaaS)

### ðŸ”¹ IaaS (Infrastructure as a Service)
- Provides infrastructure: servers, storage, networking.  
- Example: AWS EC2, Azure VMs.  
- âœ… Best for: system administrators, custom environments.  

### ðŸ”¹ PaaS (Platform as a Service)
- Provides platform for developing applications.  
- Example: AWS Elastic Beanstalk, Heroku.  
- âœ… Best for: developers focusing on coding, not infra.  

### ðŸ”¹ SaaS (Software as a Service)
- Provides ready-to-use software via internet.  
- Example: Gmail, Office 365, Salesforce.  
- âœ… Best for: end-users, no infra management.

## âœ… Task 4: History of AWS

- **2002** â†’ AWS launched as a set of web services.  
- **2006** â†’ Amazon S3 (storage) and EC2 (compute) launched.  
- **2012** â†’ First AWS re:Invent conference.  
- **2014** â†’ AWS Lambda introduced (serverless computing).  
- **2015** â†’ AWS revenue crosses $5B.  
- **2020** â†’ AWS covers 245+ countries & regions.  
- **2023** â†’ AWS leads cloud market share (~33%).  

AWS today is the **worldâ€™s most widely adopted cloud platform** powering startups, enterprises, and governments.
